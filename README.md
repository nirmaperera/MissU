# MissU

  The objective was to create a web application that provides the user a list of missing people by filtering missing people cases in the United States based on user input of Name, Last seen location and date, etc. In addition the user can also add a tip on a missing person case. For this project, we used the Missing Person data set from OpenDataSoft API.
  
Note:
Users can only add a tip after signing into google.
